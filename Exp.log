Experiment 1:
    model: ac_v1 (with dorpoout and max 300 hid_dim)
    epochs: 200000
    model_weight_save: every 200 epochs (1)
    training time: around 30 mins
    loss: mse

Experiment 2:
    model: ac_v2 (with batch_normalization and max 300*2 hid_dim)
    epochs: 200000*25
    model_weight_save: every 200 epochs (1)
    training time: around ? mins
    loss: mse
    ssh stops at 220 epochs
